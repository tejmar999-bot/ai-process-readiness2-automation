I need to update my AI Readiness Assessment app scoring logic with a new simplified approach:

SCORING LOGIC:

1. CALCULATE RAW SCORES
Each dimension = sum of 3 questions (range 3-15)
All 6 dimensions: Process Maturity, Technology Infrastructure, Data Readiness, People & Culture, Leadership & Alignment, Governance & Risk

2. CALCULATE TOTAL SCORE
Total score = simple sum of all 6 raw dimension scores
Maximum possible = 90 points (6 dimensions × 15 max each)
Percentage = total / 90

3. DETERMINE READINESS LEVEL (Based on total score only)
if total >= 70: "AI-Ready"
elif total >= 56: "Building Blocks"
elif total >= 42: "Foundational Gaps"
else: "Not Ready"

4. CRITICAL DIMENSION FLAGS (Data Readiness & Leadership & Alignment)

Display visual warnings based on critical dimension scores:

IF both Data < 9 AND Leadership < 9:
  → Show 🛑 STOP icon (red)
  → Message: "CRITICAL: Both Data Readiness and Leadership & Alignment are below threshold. AI initiatives should not proceed until these are addressed."
  → Override readiness level display with warning

ELSE IF Data < 9 OR Leadership < 9 (but not both):
  → Show ⚠️ WARNING icon (orange/yellow)
  → Message: "WARNING: [Data Readiness / Leadership & Alignment] is below threshold (scored [X]/15). This dimension must reach ≥9 before scaling AI initiatives."
  → Show alongside readiness level

ELSE (both >= 9):
  → Show ✓ icon (green)
  → Message: "Critical dimensions meet thresholds"
  → Display readiness level normally

READINESS LEVEL DEFINITIONS (use these exact labels):

"AI-Ready" (70-90 points)
- Emoji: 🟢
- Description: "Strong foundation for AI implementation. Begin strategic pilots with confidence."
- Next steps: "Select 1-2 high-value use cases, establish success metrics, launch pilots"

"Building Blocks" (56-69 points)
- Emoji: 🟠 (Yellow)
- Description: "Foundational elements in place, but improvements needed before scaling."
- Next steps: "Strengthen weak dimensions over 3-6 months, then reassess"

"Foundational Gaps" (42-55 points)
- Emoji: 🔴 (Orange)
- Description: "Significant foundational work needed before AI can deliver value."
- Next steps: "Focus on business fundamentals for 9-12 months, not AI"

"Not Ready" (<42 points)
- Emoji: ⛔ (Red)
- Description: "Focus on core operations before considering AI."
- Next steps: "Improve processes, data, infrastructure (12-18 months)"

UI/VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. OVERALL SCORE DISPLAY:
   - Total: X/90 (Y%)
   - Readiness Level: [Level] [Emoji]

2. CRITICAL DIMENSION STATUS (prominent display):
   Show one of these three states:
   
   🛑 STOP - Both Critical Dimensions Below Threshold
   "Do not proceed with AI initiatives. Address Data Readiness (X/15) and Leadership & Alignment (Y/15) first."
   
   ⚠️ WARNING - One Critical Dimension Below Threshold  
   "[Data Readiness / Leadership & Alignment] scored X/15 (needs ≥9). Address this before scaling AI."
   
   ✓ READY - Both Critical Dimensions Meet Threshold
   "Data Readiness: X/15 ✓ | Leadership & Alignment: Y/15 ✓"

3. DIMENSION BREAKDOWN:
   - Bar chart or table showing all 6 dimensions
   - Scores out of 15 for each
   - Mark Data Readiness and Leadership & Alignment with ⭐ (critical)
   - Highlight in red/orange if critical dimension < 9

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   Generate recommendations based on:
   
   Priority 1 (if applicable):
   - If Data < 9: "CRITICAL: Improve Data Readiness from X to ≥9 (conduct data inventory, establish governance, clean up quality)"
   - If Leadership < 9: "CRITICAL: Improve Leadership & Alignment from X to ≥9 (executive education, business case, secure budget)"
   
   Priority 2:
   - Address weakest non-critical dimension
   
   Priority 3:
   - Readiness-level-specific next steps

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS TO TEST:

1. All scores = 5 (total = 90)
   → "AI-Ready" + ✓ READY (both critical = 15)

2. Data = 8, Leadership = 14, others average 12 (total ≈ 67)
   → "Building Blocks" + ⚠️ WARNING (Data below 9)

3. Data = 8, Leadership = 8, others = 15 (total = 76)
   → "AI-Ready" + 🛑 STOP (both critical below 9)
   → Even though total score suggests "AI-Ready", show STOP warning prominently

4. Data = 12, Leadership = 13, others average 8 (total = 57)
   → "Building Blocks" + ✓ READY (both critical meet threshold)

The key principle: Simple total score determines readiness level, but critical dimension flags provide important warnings. If both critical dimensions are below 9, show a prominent STOP warning regardless of total score.

Please update scoring.py, the UI/visualization components, and recommendation generation to match this logic exactly. Ensure all references to the critical dimension threshold use 9 consistently.
