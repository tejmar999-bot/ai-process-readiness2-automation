I need to create a downloadable HTML report (not PDF) that summarizes the assessment results in a clean, printable format. The report should be 2 pages maximum and optimized for printing in color.

REPORT STRUCTURE:

PAGE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
========================

Header:
- T-Logic Consulting logo (top right)
- Title: "AI Readiness Assessment Results"
- Assessment Date: [Date]
- Company: [Name if available]

Key Metrics Section (3 boxes side-by-side):
- Box 1: Total Score: X/90 (Y%)
- Box 2: Readiness Level: [Level] [Emoji]
- Box 3: Average Score: X/15

Critical Dimension Alert (if applicable):
- Prominent warning box (orange/yellow background)
- Show ⚠️ WARNING or 🛑 STOP icon based on critical dimension status
- Message text explaining which critical dimension(s) are below threshold

Scoring Model Reference Table:
- 4 rows showing score ranges, readiness levels, and meanings
- Highlight the current readiness level row

Dimension Scores Visual:
- Horizontal bar chart showing all 6 dimensions (X/15)
- Mark critical dimensions (Data Readiness, Leadership) with ⭐
- Color code bars: Red (<7), Orange (7-9), Green (10-12), Dark Green (13-15)

Executive Summary:
- 3-4 sentence paragraph summarizing overall readiness
- Key finding about strongest areas and gaps
- Critical dimension status summary

---

PAGE 2: RECOMMENDATIONS & ACTION PLAN
=====================================

Dimension-by-Dimension Analysis:
For each of 6 dimensions, show:
- Dimension name with icon
- Score: X/15 (Y%)
- Status assessment (one sentence)
- Top 2-3 specific recommendations (bullet points)
- Use compact cards/sections to fit all 6

Priority Action Items:
- Extract top 3-4 most critical recommendations
- Number as Priority 1, 2, 3, 4
- Include timeline estimate for each
- Focus on critical dimension gaps first

Timeline Roadmap:
- 30-day actions
- 90-day actions  
- 6-month goals

Call-to-Action Footer:
- "Let's Discuss Your AI Journey" heading
- Brief text about consultation offer
- Contact information or booking link
- Professional but inviting tone

DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:

1. USE LIGHT THEME FOR PRINTABILITY:
   - White or light gray (#F9FAFB) background
   - Dark text (#1F2937) for body content
   - Orange (#F97316) for headers and accents (keep brand color)
   - Use your current color scheme for status indicators

2. TYPOGRAPHY:
   - Headers: 18-24px, bold
   - Subheaders: 14-16px, semi-bold
   - Body text: 11-12px (smaller for print)
   - Use system fonts (Arial, Helvetica, or similar)

3. LAYOUT:
   - Max width: 8.5" (letter size)
   - Margins: 0.5" on all sides
   - Add CSS for page break between page 1 and 2:
     .page-break { page-break-after: always; }

4. PRINT OPTIMIZATION:
   - Add @media print CSS rules
   - Remove background colors for large areas (use borders instead)
   - Ensure all text is readable in grayscale
   - Add "Page X of 2" footer on each page

5. COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE:
   - Same content as current results screen
   - Condense to fit 2 pages
   - Prioritize critical information
   - Remove redundant elements

6. DOWNLOAD FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Generate HTML file with inline CSS (no external dependencies)
   - Filename: "AI_Readiness_Assessment_Report_[Date].html"
   - User clicks "Download Report" button
   - File opens in browser, can be printed or saved

---

CONTENT TO PULL FROM CURRENT RESULTS:

From Image 1 (Assessment Results):
- Total Score, Readiness Level, Average Score
- Critical dimension warning box

From Image 2 (Scoring Model & Executive Summary):
- Scoring model table
- Executive summary paragraph

From Image 3 (Dimension Breakdown):
- Radar chart OR convert to horizontal bar chart (better for print)
- All 6 dimension scores

From Image 4 (Industry Benchmark):
- SKIP THIS - not essential for individual report
- Can mention "compared to industry average" in executive summary

From Image 5 (Detailed Comparison):
- SKIP THIS - too detailed for 2-page summary

From Images 6-9 (Recommended Actions):
- All 6 dimension recommendations
- Condense each dimension card to fit page 2

From Image 10 (CTA):
- Include at bottom of page 2
- Contact information and consultation offer

---

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Create a new function: generate_html_report()
2. Use template string with all HTML/CSS inline
3. Include current assessment data (scores, recommendations, etc.)
4. Add download button on results page: "📄 Download Report"
5. When clicked, trigger file download of generated HTML
6. HTML should be standalone (no external CSS/JS files)
7. Optimized for Chrome/Firefox/Safari print functionality

EXAMPLE DOWNLOAD BUTTON CODE:
```python
# In your Flask route or component:
@app.route('/download_report/<assessment_id>')
def download_report(assessment_id):
    # Get assessment data
    assessment = get_assessment_data(assessment_id)
    
    # Generate HTML report
    html_content = generate_html_report(assessment)
    
    # Return as downloadable file
    return Response(
        html_content,
        mimetype='text/html',
        headers={
            'Content-Disposition': f'attachment; filename=AI_Readiness_Report_{assessment_id}.html'
        }
    )
```

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Generate clean 2-page HTML structure with inline CSS
2. Pull all data from current assessment results
3. Optimize layout for printing (light theme, proper spacing)
4. Add download functionality
5. Test print preview to ensure 2-page limit

The report should look professional enough to present to executives while being concise enough to print and review in 5 minutes.
